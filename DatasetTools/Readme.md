# DataSetTools Introduction
For some datasets not providing groundtruth trajectory, such as The Visual-Inertial Canoe Dataset, we have to generate the groundtruth trajectory ourselves to compare
with the trajectories generated by SLAM and calculate the error.

This project is aimed to generate groundtruth trajectory from .csv profiles.

#### readimu.cpp  
 Read imu datas from .csv files which may should be filtered before.  
 The format of the data read in this file is:
 > timestamp north velocity east velocity up velocity roll pitch azimuth (according to [The Visual-Inertial Canoe Dataset](https://experts.illinois.edu/en/datasets/the-visual-inertial-canoe-dataset-2))
 
 - tips: north velocity corresponds to the z-axis speed of the camera coordinate system, while east corresponds to x-axis and up corresponds to negative y-axis.

#### readdata.cpp
Get imu data and calculate the groundtruth trajectory which is saved as a .txt file.
Then we can use evo to evaluation the result.[evo](https://github.com/MichaelGrupp/evo)

#### choose_csv.py
Filter the data in .csv file and associate the image file with timestamp(provide the times.txt in DSO). 

#### getrosbaginfo.py
Get infos from rosbag including GPS
