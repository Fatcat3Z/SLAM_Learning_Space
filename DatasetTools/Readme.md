# DataSetTools Introduction
For some datasets not providing groundtruth trajectory, such as The Visual-Inertial Canoe Dataset, we have to generate the groundtruth trajectory ourselves to compare
with the trajectories generated by SLAM and calculate the error.

This project is aimed to generate groundtruth trajectory from .csv profiles.

 Read imu datas from .csv files which may should be filtered before.  
 The format of the data read in this file is:
 > timestamp north velocity east velocity up velocity roll pitch azimuth (according to [The Visual-Inertial Canoe Dataset](https://experts.illinois.edu/en/datasets/the-visual-inertial-canoe-dataset-2))
