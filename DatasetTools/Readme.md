# DataSetTools Introduction
For some datasets not providing groundtruth trajectory, such as The Visual-Inertial Canoe Dataset, we have to generate the groundtruth trajectory ourselves to compare
with the trajectories generated by SLAM and calculate the error.

This project is aimed to generate groundtruth trajectory from .csv profiles.

#### GetIMUNGPSdata

#### GetGPSfromROSBAG
Get all gps data from rosbag and choose KSXT data to show in Google earth
